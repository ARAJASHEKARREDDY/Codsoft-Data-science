<h3>Task 2:MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON</h3>
      
In this project, I built a movie rating prediction system using Python. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, and the development of a machine learning model to predict movie ratings.The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques.
